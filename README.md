# S2I Builder for Angular Apps

This repository contains the source for building Angular applications based on
the official httpd24 CentOS and Red Hat images using source-to-image (S2I).
This image supports incremental builds by reusing the `node_modules` folder
between builds. To use this, you must enable incremental builds in your build
configuration.

For building Angular 2-5 apps, use the `angular5` branch instead.

For more information about using these images with OpenShift, please see the
official OpenShift documentation.

## Configuration

The following configuration environment variables are specific to this image:

* **NG_CONFIG** - the Angular configuration to pass to `ng build`. This
    defaults to `production`.
* **NODE_ENV** - this defaults to `production`.
* **NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL** - this defaults to `info`.

All other environment variables from the base image can also be overriden.

Additionally, you can mount Angular environment files in `/tmp/ng-environments/`
and they will be copied to `./src/environments/`. This is useful if you'd like
to override the environment files stored in source.

## Installation

To build an Angular Docker image, choose either the CentOS or RHEL based image.

### CentOS Based Image

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it, run:

```bash
$ sudo docker pull docker pull mprahl/s2i-angular-httpd24
```

To build your Angular app image with S2I, run:

```bash
$ sudo s2i build <git_url> mprahl/s2i-angular-httpd24 <app_image_name>
```

### RHEL Based Image

This image is not on any public registries, so you must build it from scratch.
To build it, run:

```bash
$ sudo docker build -t mprahl/s2i-angular-httpd24-rhel7 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mprahl/s2i-angular-httpd24/master/Dockerfile.rhel7
```

To build your Angular app image with S2I, run:

```bash
$ sudo s2i build <git_url> mprahl/s2i-angular-httpd24-rhel7 <app_image_name>
```

## Testing

This repository contains an Angular demo app produced from
`ng new test-app --minimal` in the directory `test/test-app`. This can be used
for testing purposes. To build a Docker image with this demo app, run:

```bash
$ sudo s2i build https://github.com/mprahl/s2i-angular-httpd24 \
    --context-dir=test/test-app/ mprahl/s2i-angular-httpd24 angular-demo-app
$ sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 angular-demo-app
```

## OpenShift

To use the S2I image within OpenShift, you must create an image stream
in your project. To do this, run:

```bash
$ oc create -f s2i-angular-httpd24.yml
```

Alternatively, if you'd prefer to have the OpenShift image stream available
globally, you can create the image stream in the `openshift` namespace. To do
this, run:

```bash
$ oc create -f s2i-angular-httpd24.yml -n openshift
```

To view the newly created image stream, run:

```bash
$ oc describe imagestream s2i-angular-httpd24
```

The builder image will now appear as "Angular" under the category "JavaScript"
in the OpenShift UI.
